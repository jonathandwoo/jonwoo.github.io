                    On this page, students can find class resources including extra study materials, 
                    additional notes from discussions and office hours, and interesting problems to supplement their studies.

                    Below that, I have included some resources for teaching and tutoring. If you would like more detailed

                    Teaching and tutoring have been two of the most rewarding opportunities in my life.
                    I believe each and every student is deserving of genuine learning as opposed to rote memorization and lecturing.
                    To this end, I am guided by the mission of sharing with students the joys of learning.
