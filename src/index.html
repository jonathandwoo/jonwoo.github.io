                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a Ph.D. student at UCLA studying applied mathematics. 
                    My academic interests generally include differential equations and numerical analysis
                    with applications to science and engineering.
                    I am also very passionate about teaching and tutoring students in science and math (see the <a href="teaching.html">Teaching page</a> to learn more).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the classroom, you can usually find me playing basketball and tennis, reading, or occasionally on the video game.
                    My favorite basketball player is Payton Pritchard, my favorite tennis player is Ben Shelton, 
                    my favorite book series is The Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski.
